// Let module system know we will be using the Vue router
Vue.use(VueRouter)

// 1. Import route components
import Follow from "follow"


// 2. Define some routes
// Each route should map to a component. The "component" can
// either be an actual component constructor created via
// Vue.extend(), or just a component options object.
// We'll talk about nested routes later.
const routes = [
  { path: '/follow/:username', component: Follow }
]

// 3. Create the router instance and pass the `routes` option
// You can pass in additional options here, but let's
// keep it simple for now.
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes
})

// 4. Create and mount the root instance.
// Make sure to inject the router with the router option to make the
// whole app router-aware.
const app = new Vue({
  router
}).$mount('#app')
